## 🧠 How It Works

1. Video input is captured from CCTV/webcam/uploaded video  
2. Frames are extracted and preprocessed  
3. Frames are passed to a trained violence detection model  
4. Model predicts **Violence / Non-Violence**  
5. If violence is detected:
   - Alert is triggered  
   - Notification is sent  
   - Incident is logged
